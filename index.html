          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Git is a <strong>Distributed Version Control System</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Every user who clones a repository has the entire history on their
            machine.
          </p>

          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Allowing you to vew the history of changes and revert to an older
            version easily.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Git & Github</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Git is a Version Control System
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Github is a hosting service for git repositories.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Github is a place to store your work (think of this as a back up, a
            copy of your work stored elsewhere) and collaborate with others.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Whilst Git and Github work well together, they are two separate
            products. Github can be replaced by any other repo hosting service.
            E.g. Azure, Bit Bucket etc.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What is a repository (repo)?</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            A repo is a collection of all of the files (and folders) you're
            tracking with git.
          </p>

          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            There are two sides to the repo, <strong>local</strong> and
            <strong>server</strong>.
          </p>

          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Local is the copy which is on your machine and server is the copy
            which is on the hosting service.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Suggested Workflow</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Github flow (1/2)</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Github flow is a standard practice for managing a repository.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You have one main branch called master. Master contains your working
            code. I.e. a working SQL Script, the working website, a report which
            gets sent to customers. What ever it is.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You never commit changes directly to master. This way you always
            have the latest working copy.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Github flow (2/2)</h2>

          <p>
            When someone asks for changes, you create a new branch from master.
            This is a feature branch.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Once that feature branch is fully working, tested and signed off.
            You merge it in to the Master branch.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Master has now been updated to the latest version.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Basic Commands</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Committing</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Think of this as saving your work.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Once you have made some changes and commited them, you have a
            snapshot of your work at a certain point in time.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You will be able to move forward and make more changes on top of
            this. If you fuck up, you can roll back to this commit that you know
            works. Either discarding the breaking changes, or saving them to
            work with later.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Branching</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Creating a branch creates and entirely new copy of the repo for you
            to work with.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You can make as many commits and changes to the new branch as you
            like, without affecting the original branch.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Once the work is complete, you can merge this branch in to the
            original one and combine the changes.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Merging</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Once the work on a feature has been completed and is ready to become
            the main version, you merge it in to master.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            This will integrate the feature branch with master.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Merge Conflicts</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            If master is ahead of your feature (i.e. someone else has merged to
            master) you will get merge conflicts which need to be sorted.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            The best way to deal with conflicts is to merge master in your
            feature, so you have the latest changes. Fix the merge conflicts
            locally and then merge back to master.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Pushing</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            So far we have been working completely offline. The hosting service
            knows nothing about your changes.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            When you are ready for your changes to be saved to the repo, you
            <strong>push</strong> the branch.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Pushing a branch syncs all of you commits with the cloud. You can
            work offline for days, and then sync all the changes when you get a
            connection.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Pulling</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You pull a branch to get the latest version from the cloud on to
            your machine.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            This is useful when multiple people are working on the same
            repository and you want to get their latesst changes.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Pushing & Pulling cont.</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            The push and pull commands work on a branch level.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You can push all of your local commits, or pull all of the server
            commits for a branch in one go.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You can not push or pull multiple branches in one go.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Cloning & Initializing</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            <strong>Cloning </strong> is pretty much what it sounds like. Take a
            copy of an online repository so it can be worked on from your
            machine. <strong>Initializing</strong> starts a new git repositiroy.
            It can either be an empty folder structure, or an existing one.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Installing Git</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Download the installer from
            <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/"
              >https://git-scm.com/</a
            >
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Once installed open a command prompt and run
          </p>
          <pre
            class="fragment fade-up"
          ><code data-trim data-noescape>git --version</code></pre>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            If the install was successful you will see the version information
          </p>

          <h2>Hands On (1/4)</h2>
          <p>
            Let's assume you already have a folder structure you would like to
            turn in to a git repo.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            In your command prompt navigate to the folder and run the init
            command:
          </p>
          <pre
            class="fragment fade-up"

        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Hands On (2/4)</h2>

          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Some files you don't want git to track. Passwords, secrets or nudy
            photos. Adding a .gitignore file will stop them being synced to the
            remote repo
          </p>

          <pre
            class="fragment fade-up"

          <h2>Hands On (3/4)</h2>

          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Now you're all set up, you need to stage your files. This tells git
            they are ready to commit.
          </p>

          <pre
            class="fragment fade-up"
          ><code data-trim data-noescape>git add .</code></pre>
        </section>

          <h2>Hands On (4/4)</h2>

          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            You're ready to make your first commit.
          </p>

          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Sign up for a Github account and create a new repo.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            Copy the commands to push an existing repository from the command
            line and run them from your command line.

          <h2>Using a GUI</h2>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            For the little example exercise we used the command line. If you're
            comfortable with it you can continue to use it for all of your work.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            I like to use a GUI to simplify things and see a visual
            representation of the history.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment fade-up">
            I use <a href="https://gitkraken.com">Git Kraken</a>, but there are
            loads of alternatives you can experiment with.
